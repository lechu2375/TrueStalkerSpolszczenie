Czego potrzebujesz?
Uff... Chyba ich zgubiliśmy. Dziwne - nasz człowiek miał być na straży i nie powinni nas zauważyć. Coś poszło nie tak i ktoś inny przejął kontrolę. Zajmę się tym później; nie mogę prowadzić nowicjuszy w taki sposób.
To się zdarza. Nie byłem w Strefie od jakiegoś czasu i już dyszę po małym biegu!
Tak. Szkoda, że tym razem nam się nie udało. Ta ścieżka będzie zamknięta na jakiś czas... Następnym razem musimy upewnić się, że odpowiedni człowiek pilnuje.
Nie martw się. Jesteśmy żywi, a to dobry znak.
Zgadza się. Usiądźmy przy ognisku i wypijmy za naszą ucieczkę. I tak nie możemy nigdzie iść w taką pogodę.
Brzmi dobrze!
Co sprawiło, że chciałeś wrócić do Strefy?
Co mogę powiedzieć? Po kilku wizytach tutaj, nie mogę przestać o tym myśleć. To jest miejsce, gdzie pragnę zostać.
Każdy mówi mi dokładnie to samo: że wszyscy macie coś wspólnego... albo, powinienem powiedzieć, że *my* mamy coś wspólnego. Nie mogę dojść, co trzyma mnie tutaj. Prawdę mówiąc, staram się pozostać w Kordonie, chociaż nowicjusze tutaj trzymają mój portfel pełny - prawie codziennie potrzebują przewodnika. Szkoda, że wielu z nich znika lub umiera. Wypijmy za to, żeby to się więcej nie zdarzało!
Na zdrowie!
Ah, w punkt! Ja sam wszedłem do Strefy z moim kumplem Witką. Wtedy mój syn zginął w wypadku samochodowym ???... moja suka żona poszła na popijawę... Jestem emocjonalnym człowiekiem, więc bardzo się martwiłem. Spotkałem się z Witką, podzieliliśmy się butelką czy dwiema - tak jak ty i ja teraz - i rozluźniłem język, zacząłem mu opowiadać o moich problemach. Wtedy nic nie trzymało mnie w domu, więc przyjąłem jego propozycję wyjazdu do Strefy na odstresowanie.\n \nPodczas drogi tam, opowiedział mi, jak już miał doświadczenie w Strefie. Podzielił się ze mną wieloma ciekawymi rzeczami, ale w stanie, w jakim byłem wtedy, nie zwracałem na to zbyt dużo uwagi - szukałem sposobu na odreagowanie po tym, co się stało. Potem poszliśmy do Kordonu... Hej, nie zapomnij przekąsić!
Tak, człowieku, życie cię mocno uderzyło... Wypijmy jeszcze jednego...
To się zdarza, prawda? Teraz, co do Witki, zdecydował się udać dalej poza Kordon. Biedak zapłacił za to cenę... Nie słyszałem od niego od pół roku, a wszystko, co dostaję od pytania nowicjuszy z Śmietnika o niego, to wzruszenie ramionami. Tam zaczęło się dziać coś naprawdę poważnego... mnóstwo bandyckiego śmiecia, anomalie na całej mapie... ale mimo wszystkiego tego, nie rozumiesz, co trzyma cię tutaj, w tej przeklętej Strefie... Głęboko w środku, może masz nadzieję spotkać swojego przyjaciela, który przeżył jakimś cudem?... Naleję ci jeszcze jednego...
Tragiczna historia. Nawet nie wiem, co powiedzieć...
Nie martw się tym. Wypijmy jeszcze jednego!
Naprawdę to czuję... Prawie wcale nie piję, ale okazja na to zasługuje. Jeszcze jeden!
Cześć. Czego potrzebujesz?
Hej, Sidorowicz! Wróciłem do Strefy i jestem gotowy do pracy. Masz coś?
Wróciłeś? Nigdy cię tu nie widziałem.
No daj spokój, Sid, nie możesz być poważny. To ja, Topór!
Zgadza się! Topór! Ten, który przedostał się do Strefy z siekierą na ramieniu!
Dla przypomnienia, posiekałem psa.
Mogłeś mnie nabrać. Nasi chłopcy go zranili, a ty tylko skróciłeś cierpienia tego biednego mutanta.
Dobra, wystarczy tych uprzejmości. Masz dla mnie jakąś robotę?
Najpierw powinieneś się przespać po wczorajszym pijaństwie, a *potem* wrócić do pracy.
Cóż, mam...
Znowu dałem się nabrać, hah! W każdym razie, mam dla ciebie kilka zadań. Mój łowca artefaktów wyruszył na zbiory i gdzieś zniknął. Sądzę, że albo znalazł coś cennego i uciekł z tym, albo tamtejsze psy znalazły coś "cennego" i zrobiły sobie z niego obiad. Idź tam i spójrz, dobrze? W tunelu pod mostem jest anomalia, czyli dokładnie tam, dokąd zmierzał.
Jaka jest zapłata?
Pokaż mi jakieś wyniki i porozmawiamy. Masz cały potrzebny sprzęt. Tylko nie daj się złapać żołnierzom - słyszałem, że wczoraj w nocy podnieśli alarm i poszli kogoś szukać. To pewnie te nic niewarte żółtodzioby! Nie mogą nawet przejść przez punkt kontrolny bez bycia zauważonym.
Pokaż mi jakieś wyniki, to pogadamy. Oto kawałek na dobry początek. Tylko nie daj się złapać żołnierzom - słyszałem, że podnieśli alarm zeszłej nocy i poszli kogoś szukać. To pewnie te nic niewarte żółtodzioby! Nie mogą nawet przejść przez punkt kontrolny bez bycia zauważonym.
Tak, naprawdę to spieprzyli, co? Dobra, lecę do tunelu.
Cholera... Mam przejebane.
Jak to możliwe? Twoje PDA jest na tym ciele! Myślałem, że nie żyjesz!
Widzisz, właśnie o to chodzi: chciałem, żeby wszyscy myśleli, że już po mnie. Mam dość załatwiania spraw Sida za darmo! Mam u niego dług... i to kupę forsy! Nie mogę tak po prostu od tego odejść, a miną miesiące, zanim wszystko spłacę, więc opracowałem ten mały plan: znalazłem tego biednego drania, który wpadł na bandę psów, ubrałem go w moje ubranie i zostawiłem PDA.
Jesteś naprawdę kimś! Dlaczego więc wróciłeś?
Upuściłem wykrywacz w pobliżu tunelu. Nie mogę pozwolić, żeby to się zmarnowało.
W porządku, nie martw się. Nie powiem Sidowi.
Naprawdę? Wow, dzięki! Dałbym ci coś w nagrodę, ale jestem ogołocony ze wszystkiego. Jadę do Agropromu. Może tam coś znajdę. Tutaj mam tylko napój energetyczny - mały prezent dla ciebie!
Przyda się, jeśli będę musiał ratować skórę. Dobra, powodzenia!
Tylko nic nie mów handlarzowi, stalkerze.
Nie martw się. Nie powiem.
Cóż, Sid, twój Kutyok jest skończony.
Co się stało?
Zmiażdżony na śmierć przez psy. Jego szczątki znajdują się w pobliżu tunelu. Oto jego PDA.
Znalazłem go przy tunelu - jest teraz karmą dla psów. Mam jego PDA i artefakt z tunelu.
Nic się jeszcze nie stało, ale możesz wszystko naprawić. Postanowił cię oszukać.
Cóż, to jest Strefa dla ciebie! Naprawdę szkoda - był dobrym kolekcjonerem. Facet potrafił wykonać robotę za trzech ludzi, gdy tylko zaszła taka potrzeba... Ważne, że był uczciwy. Ciekawe kto kiedyś zajmie jego miejsce...
Świetna robota. Co do artefaktu, dam ci jeszcze pięć stów i tyle. Naprawdę szkoda - był dobrym kolekcjonerem. Facet wykonywał pracę trzech ludzi, kiedy tylko zaszła taka potrzeba... Ważne, że był uczciwy. Zastanawiam się, kto kiedykolwiek zajmie jego miejsce?...
Naprawdę, teraz?
Nie wiem. Mogę spróbować, jeśli ci to nie przeszkadza?
Zostawił swoje PDA na czyimś ciele i planował odejść. Powiedział mi, że ukrywa się, bo jest ci wiele winien. Przypadkiem znalazłem go, gdy wracał po detektor.
Zostawił swoje PDA na czyimś ciele i planował odejść. Powiedział mi, że ukrywa się, bo jest ci wiele winien. Tak się złożyło, że znalazłem go, gdy wracał po wykrywacz. Do tego dochodzi artefakt.
Czemu nie? Pamiętaj tylko, że wynagrodzenie nie jest najlepsze. Nie dam więcej niż półtora tysiąca za każdy artefakt, ale poczekamy i zobaczymy, co przyniesiesz. Możesz pozbyć się tego swojego starożytnego detektora... oto prawdziwy dla ciebie. Nie zapomnij go oddać!
Czego? Ten sukinsyn...! Kiedy go znajdę, pożałuje tego. Jeszcze trochę za twoją uczciwość.
Co? Ten sukinsyn...! Kiedy go znajdę, pożałuje tego. Jeszcze trochę za szczerość i za artefakt.
Dla mnie działa. Podaj mi współrzędne.
Mógłbym spróbować przejąć jego pracę, jeśli nie masz nic przeciwko.
Dlaczego nie? Pamiętaj tylko, że wynagrodzenie nie jest najlepsze. Nie dam więcej niż półtora tysiąca za każdy artefakt, ale poczekamy i zobaczymy, co przyniesiesz. Możesz pozbyć się tego swojego starożytnego detektora... oto prawdziwy dla ciebie. Nie zapomnij go oddać!
Wchodzę w to. Podaj mi współrzędne.
Uff. Skończyłem z artefaktami.
Dobra robota. Pokaż mi, co zdobyłeś.
Tutaj. To wszystko, co udało mi się znaleźć.
Doskonale się nada! Oto twoje zasłużone pieniądze, uczciwie i uczciwie.
Postradałeś zmysły? To nawet nie połowa tego, ile warte są te artefakty! Prawie się za nie zmarnowałem, a ty nic mi za to nie dajesz!
No już, Axe, nie denerwuj się. Nie mogę dać ci więcej. W końcu dałem ci dobry wykrywacz - jak znalazłbyś artefakty bez niego? Znajdź więcej po tym, a kupię go za dobrą cenę. Przy okazji, Fanatyk chciał cię widzieć na zewnątrz. Mówi, że ma legowisko psów, którym trzeba się zająć i przydałaby mu się dodatkowa siła ognia... więc pospiesz się!
Nic się nie zmieniłeś, stary pierdzielu.
Sid, gdzie twój laptop? Miałeś go w zeszłym roku. Zepsuł się?
Tak, zepsuł się... Teraz siedzę tu i pracuję na tym niezgrabnym śmieciu. Dzięki za przypomnienie: Musisz wpaść do technika w wiosce. Zostawiłem mu laptopa do naprawy dwa miesiące temu... Pewnie już go naprawił, a skoro jeszcze nie ruszył tyłka i nie przyniósł go tutaj, idź tam, porozmawiaj z nim i przynieś go tutaj.
Jeśli jest ktoś, kto powinien ruszyć tyłek, Sid, to właśnie ty! Siedzenie tutaj i rozkazywanie ludziom...
Rób, co mówię - będzie z tego mała nagroda. Nie będziesz bogaty, ale to ci się opłaci. I tak byś tamtędy przejeżdżał!
W porządku, przekonałeś mnie. Zaraz wracam.
Nie, Sid. Nie będę dla ciebie załatwiał spraw. Załatw mi coś poważniejszego...
Myślałem... Trochę się rozpędziłem. Nadal chcesz, żebym przyniósł laptopa?
To nic takiego. Tak, na pewno nie miałbym nic przeciwko temu, żeby go tu teraz mieć...
W takim razie spadam.
Hej, Michałycz! Przyszedłem po laptopa Sida. Naprawiłeś go?
Tak, dobrze, że wpadłeś. Nie mam czasu bawić się w dostawcę dla tego klauna. Weź laptopa i pozdrów go ode mnie.
Zrozumiałem. Do zobaczenia później.
Ej, frajerze, opróżnij wszystko, co znalazłeś w anomalii i zrób to szybko!
Czy to twoja anomalia?
Jak to "moja anomalia"? To tylko rutynowa inspekcja kieszeni, debilu!
Jasne, bierz. Nie ujdzie ci to jednak na sucho.
Zrobisz sobie krzywdę takim pistoletem.
I tak nic mi nie będzie. A teraz spadaj!
Cóż... ostrzegałem cię, jak coś. Gdybym był na twoim miejscu, uważałbym na to, gdzie chodzę.
Pa.
Na twoim miejscu zamknąłbym gębę.
To znowu ja? Fanatyk mnie przysłał - mówi, że jesteś tu naprawiaczem broni. Mógłbyś naprawić mojego AK?
Później, dobrze? Mówiłem ci, mam teraz mnóstwo pracy. Zostaw to tutaj, naprawię później.
Tutaj. Może masz dla mnie jakąś robotę? Gdy jesteś zajęty, mógłbym pomóc - nie mam pieniędzy, by zapłacić ci za naprawę.
Właściwie to mógłbyś mi pomóc już teraz! Mam coś, czym muszę się zająć...
O co chodzi?
Każdej nocy na nizinach - tam, gdzie znajdują się radioaktywne bagna - widzę te dziwne unoszące się światła. To muszą być artefakty, w dodatku bardzo rzadkie! Poszedłem tam za dnia, ale nic nie znalazłem. Wygląda na to, że pojawiają się tylko w nocy... a noc ma swoje własne niebezpieczeństwa. Jestem technikiem, a nie wojownikiem, a ostatnio w okolicy było wystarczająco dużo mutantów. Jeśli sprawdzisz to miejsce i odzyskasz artefakty, naprawię twój karabin i dam ci zniżkę na przyszłe zamówienia. Co ty na to?
Wchodzę w to. Bez karabinu będzie ciężko, więc nie mam wyboru.
Byłem tam w nocy. Mogę powiedzieć, że to poltergeisty, ale dla pewności sprawdzę to jeszcze raz.
Byłem tam w nocy. Mogę powiedzieć, że to są poltergeisty i już się z nimi uporałem. Niestety dla ciebie, nie ma tam żadnych artefaktów.
W takim razie mam kilka antyradów na podróż. Nie zabaw tam długo. Powodzenia!
Oczywiście, sprawdź to. Zaopatrz się w kilka antyradów i postaraj się szybko dotrzeć na miejsce. Powodzenia!
Cholera, a już byłem podekscytowany... Dobra. Zostaw tu swój AK, a ja zadzwonię, gdy naprawa zostanie zakończona.
Niedługo wrócę.
Zobaczymy, co się stanie. Do widzenia.
Świetnie.
Czego jeszcze potrzebujesz? Kazałem ci wracać w nocy!
No wiesz... Dobra, wychodzę.
Dobra, teraz jest dobry moment. Oto kilka antyradów. Będę czekał.
Wrócę, zanim się obejrzysz.
Oto twój laptop, staruszku.
Wreszcie mogę pracować na czymś w połowie przyzwoitym! Muszę tylko skończyć i zapisać kilka rzeczy. A dla ciebie mały prezent. A teraz idź odpocząć.
Ja to wezmę.
Dobra, teraz jest właściwy moment! Oto kilka antyradów. A teraz idź do anomalii, zanim arties znikną!
Zaraz tam będę!
Jak idzie z artefaktami?
Zajmuję się tym.
Więc, Mikhalych, o jakich pieprzonych "artefaktach" mówiłeś? Znalazłem tylko poltergeisty, i to trzy!
Naprawdę? Cholera...
Tak, to była kupa gówna! Ledwo je zdjąłem.
Tak, to była kupa gówna! Ledwo uratowałem własną skórę!
Cholera. Mieli prawdziwy blask...
Jasne. Nie obchodzi mnie, co świeciło. Napraw mój AK.
Naprawię, naprawię. W międzyczasie zajmij się innymi rzeczami. Dam ci znać, kiedy skończę.
Zgoda.
Dobra, pokaż mi, jak radzi sobie mój pokiereszowany AK.
Tutaj. Twój AK jest jak nowy! Jeśli kiedykolwiek będziesz potrzebował naprawy, wpadnij. Mam teraz na to więcej wolnego czasu.
Tutaj. Twój AK jest jak nowy! I, aby zrekompensować te kłopoty z poltergeistami, trochę amunicji - teraz jestem pewien, że nic innego nie wejdzie w tę anomalię. Jeśli kiedykolwiek będziesz potrzebował naprawić coś jeszcze, wpadnij. Mam teraz na to więcej wolnego czasu.
Dzięki. Na pewno kiedyś wpadnę!
Cześć! Sidorovich powiedział mi, że planujesz rozprawić się z mutantami. Potrzebujesz pomocy?
Nie zaszkodzi! Gotowy do przeprowadzki?
*Tak. Jak duży jest budżet na to wydarzenie?
Jaki budżet? Upewniamy się, że szumowiny nie postawią stopy w wiosce!
Przykro mi. Mam własne plany.
No wiesz, planowałem dorzucić trochę sprzętu i gotówki z rezerw wioski...
Teraz rozmawiamy!
Dobra, słuchaj. Nasza czwórka planuje zestrzelić pseudodogi - mamy ich dość i ich ataków na wioskę. Te rzeczy rozmnażają się jak króliki! Zwykle kręcą się gdzieś przy stacji pojazdów, ale nie zamierzamy ich tak po prostu zlikwidować. Musimy znaleźć ich kryjówkę i wysadzić ją w powietrze!
Jaki jest plan?
Wolf ukrył dynamit w pobliżu lokomotywy. Jeśli opuścisz wioskę i podążysz drogą do brzegu torów kolejowych, skręć w prawo i idź dalej, aż go zobaczysz. To tam musisz szukać. Znajdź dynamit i udaj się w wyznaczone przez nas miejsce. Gdy będziemy cię osłaniać, zestrzel psy i umieść dynamit przy dziurze, a następnie wysadź ją w powietrze. Łatwiej powiedzieć niż zrobić, ale damy radę. To nie potrwa długo!
Zrozumiałem. Idę.
Masz dynamit? Pospiesz się, przygotowujemy się!
Co to jest?
Hej, Axe! Potrzebujesz czegoś?
Uff! To było intensywne, ale zrobiliśmy to szybko! Mam nadzieję, że to zniechęci te bestie do mnożenia się przez jakiś czas. Oto trochę pieniędzy i AK, tak jak obiecałem... choć wymaga naprawy. Jest poobijany, a jeśli spróbujesz z niego wystrzelić, dosłownie zacina się przy każdym strzale.
Gdzie mogę go naprawić? Czy jest ktoś, kto się na tym zna?
W wiosce jest technik. Nazywa się Michałycz. Zapytaj go. Nie naprawi go za darmo, ale sądzę, że można się dogadać.
Zrozumiałem. Dzięki!
Wracamy do wioski. Idziesz z nami?
Tak, chodźmy. Odwiedzę Mikhalycha i powiem mu o broni.
Ja zostanę tutaj. Ty idź - dogonimy cię później.
Czekaj, stary. Jesteś wolny? Mam dla ciebie robotę. Może mnie rozpoznajesz - razem z Fanatykiem wyczyściliśmy legowisko psów.
Oczywiście. Powiedz mi.
Innym razem.
Znasz Yuroka, naszego przewodnika, prawda? Ten facet pożyczył od niego pieniądze i nie chce ich oddać. Yurok uratował mi kiedyś życie, więc chcę się odwdzięczyć i przynieść mu pieniądze, ale moje miejsce jest tutaj w wiosce i nie mogę się zmusić, by je opuścić. Wiem, gdzie facet się zwykle ukrywa, więc wystarczy, że wytrzaśniesz od niego pieniądze - jeśli nie będzie współpracował, wiesz co robić. Przyniesiesz mi osiem tysięcy, a ja przekażę je Yurokowi w podzięce za uratowanie mnie; resztę możesz zatrzymać. Dostaniesz też coś miłego w nagrodę. Mam tu współrzędne. Jesteś gotowy?
Jak będziesz miał czas, to wpadnij. Moja oferta jest aktualna.
Dlaczego miałbym nie pomóc tak dobremu człowiekowi jak Yurok? Daj mi współrzędne.
Nie. Odrzuć mnie i znajdź kogoś innego.
Zwykle węszy przy elewatorze zbożowym. Nie mam pojęcia, czego szuka... Powodzenia!
Jeśli zmienisz zdanie, przyjdź do mnie ponownie. Moja oferta jest aktualna.
Będę tam!
Zobaczymy.
Zastanowię się.
Jakie miałeś dla mnie zadanie?

Daj mi współrzędne. Pomogę mu.
Liczyłem na coś innego. Nie interesuje mnie to.
Zwykle jest przy elewatorze zbożowym. Szpera za czymś...
Cóż, wpadnij do mnie, jeśli znów cię to zainteresuje.
Zaraz tam będę!
Zobaczymy.
Przyszedłem w sprawie oszusta. Czy oferta jest nadal aktualna?
Tak, oczywiście. Szumowina zwykle kręci się przy elewatorze zbożowym, węsząc za czymś. Zdobądź forsę, a ja sprawię, że ci się to opłaci. Jak już mówiłem, potrzebuję ośmiu tysięcy - możesz wziąć resztę, a ja dam ci coś jeszcze.
W takim razie poczekaj tutaj. Zaraz wracam.
Zobacz, kto to! Siadaj!
Cześć. Powiedz mi, gdzie byłeś? Jakie są wiadomości?
Jak to "gdzie byłem"? Oprowadzałem tych idiotów. Zapomniałeś o mojej transakcji? Nie mogę powiedzieć, że mam jakieś wieści... Ostatnio kupiłem sobie nową strzelankę, ale poza tym wszystko po staremu. Więc leję, hehe.
Jak to "gdzie byłem"? Prowadziłem tych idiotów. Zapomniałeś o moim fachu? Nie mogę powiedzieć, że mam jakieś wieści... Ostatnio kupiłem sobie nową strzelankę, ale poza tym wszystko po staremu. Przy okazji, weź to radio. Znalazłem je przy ciele jednego z żołnierzy, o których ci mówiłem. To wszystko, co miał - powinno się przydać. Wygląda na to, że ktoś zabrał im broń i rzeczy przed mną i z jakiegoś powodu nie zabrał radia. Mógł go nie zauważyć. Lepiej użyj tego do kontaktu ze mną zamiast PDA, jeśli pojawi się coś tajnego, haha. A teraz, napijmy się!
Nalewaj!
Wielkie dzięki! A teraz nalewaj!
Oof, to było dobre! Co nowego u ciebie? Wciąż myślisz o wyprawie na Śmieci? Na samą myśl o tych wszystkich bandytach... Przyprawia mnie o dreszcze, stary!
Idzie jak po maśle. Pracuję dla Sida. Śmiem twierdzić, że w całej Strefie można znaleźć większego tandeciarza... A co jest nie tak z Garbage? Od dawna chciałem zobaczyć nowe części Strefy. Wystarczy o tym pomyśleć, co? I to nie tylko Śmieci - jest tam mnóstwo złych miejsc! Och, prawie zapomniałem: dobrze, że dałeś mi cynk o słoikach. Sprawdziłem to miejsce i znalazłem solidne radio na ciele, takie jak to, które masz. Oznacza to, że możemy się kontaktować nawet wtedy, gdy nasze PDA nie mają sygnału.
Działa. Pracuję dla Sida. Śmiem twierdzić, że w całej Strefie jest większy sknera... A co jest nie tak ze Śmieciami? Od dawna chciałem zobaczyć nowe części Strefy. Wystarczy o tym pomyśleć, co? I to nie tylko Śmieci - jest tam mnóstwo niesamowitych miejsc!
Radio na pewno się przyda. Myślałem, że ci biedacy będą całkowicie pozbawieni łupów. ??? Więc, o czym rozmawialiśmy...? O nowych miejscach? Co w tym złego? Po prostu cała masa starych opuszczonych budynków - mamy ich wystarczająco dużo na zewnątrz. Główną różnicą - i nie jest to dobra różnica, mówię ci - jest to, że kiedy kiwniesz głową, weźmiesz coś w plecy! Czy tego właśnie chcesz?
Co w tym złego? Po prostu cała masa starych opuszczonych budynków - mamy ich wystarczająco dużo na zewnątrz. Główną różnicą - i nie jest to dobra różnica, mówię ci - jest to, że kiedy kiwniesz głową, weźmiesz coś z tyłu! Czy tego właśnie chcesz?
Stary, przestań przesadzać! Może pójdziesz ze mną? Wzbogacimy się, kupimy jakiś wartościowy sprzęt i wrócimy na Kordon!
Nie, stary. Dzięki. Jest mi dobrze tu, gdzie jestem. Jestem najedzony i ubrany, mam pieniądze... co jeszcze? Przykro mi, ale odpuszczę. Stary, skończmy gadać i zacznijmy pić!
Tak, nalej już, haha!
Ugh, Axe... jeśli naprawdę zamierzasz odbyć podróż, uważaj na siebie. Strefa to nie piknik... Powinieneś wiedzieć, że wielu ludzi tam zginęło. To straszne rzeczy, o których warto pomyśleć! Weźmy na przykład mojego kumpla Vitkę. Znałem go od dziecka, a on postanowił przenieść się poza Kordon. Utrzymywaliśmy kontakt przez kilka dni, a potem... cóż, minęło pół roku, a ja nic od niego nie słyszałem. Musiał zginąć w tamtych stronach... Wypijmy...
Wypijmy! A skąd wiesz, ilu ludzi tam zginęło? To wszystko bajki. Pójdę to sprawdzić i przy okazji znajdę twojego Vitka, hehe. Jeśli wrócę, to będzie znaczyło, że te wszystkie gadki o tym, że jest tam niebezpiecznie, to kłamstwo.
Człowieku, tak sobie siedzę i myślę... Nie mam z kim pogadać oprócz ciebie. Z nikim... Jesteś dla mnie jak brat. Nie wychodź poza Kordon - pożałujesz tego! Pomyśl o wszystkich żywych dowodach na to!
Nie bądź zbyt miękki. Wszystko będzie dobrze! Pojadę tam i z powrotem, a potem podzielę się z wami moimi wrażeniami. "Żywy dowód"... Jestem szczęściarzem i wyjdę z tego w jednym kawałku. Nie mam też nikogo oprócz ciebie... Kolejna szklanka!
To niepotrzebne ryzyko, kolego. Jesteś młody i pochopny... Znikniesz w mgnieniu oka. Weterani, jeśli nie mistrzowie, zginęli w tych miejscach, a ty myślisz, że stać cię na więcej? Posłuchaj sam siebie. Tam nie ma nic do roboty!... Jeszcze jeden kieliszek?
Niedobrze mi... Znowu to zrobiłem... Och, mamo... moja głowa...
Hej! Masz jakieś zadania?
Cześć! Mam. Powiedziałbym, że dobrze się spisałeś, więc mam nadzieję, że nie pożałuję, że powierzyłem ci to zadanie...
Słucham.
Zespół naukowców wkrótce dotrze do wojskowego punktu kontrolnego. Nie wiem, czego do cholery szukają! Wiem tylko, że wkrótce wyruszą z wojskową eskortą, aby przeprowadzić badania terenowe.
Jakie badania terenowe?
Właśnie tego chcę się dowiedzieć. Może szykują coś przeciwko stalkerom, a to oznacza, że mój biznes ucierpi. Muszę wiedzieć wszystko. Będziesz ich śledził, ale ostrożnie. Zobacz, dokąd idą i co będą robić, a potem zdaj mi raport. A teraz ruszaj! Rozliczymy się później.
Zrozumiałem. Zrobię, co w mojej mocy.
Śledziłem naukowców. Zatrzymali się na łące przy stacji pojazdów i ustawili jakieś urządzenie.
Jakie coś?
Tutaj!
Czyś ty zwariował? Dlaczego, w imię elektrowni atomowej, przynieśliście to tutaj? Nawet nie wiemy, co to jest! Nie spodziewałem się tego po tobie...
Cholera. Nie sądziłem.
Ciesz się, że nie zaczęło wariować w twoich rękach! Dobra... więc... Zabierz to do technika. On może nam powiedzieć, co to jest... a potem najlepiej odłóż to na miejsce!
Hej tam! Sidorovich chciał, żebyśmy się temu przyjrzeli. Nie wiemy, do czego służy. Może ty nam powiesz.
Doobra... spójrzmy na to. Czekaj...
...
Cholera! Włączyłem to i...
Wyłącz to!
Próbuję!
Szybko! Muszę odeprzeć atak!
Odparliście ich?!
Tak! Udało się to wyłączyć?
Tak, dzięki Bogu. Ledwo się udało!
Nie wiem co to jest, ale to coś zwabiło tu mutanty. Jak tylko to wyłączyłeś, dosłownie zniknęły!
A teraz...
Pójdę do Sidorowicza. Daj to tutaj.
Nawet nie wiem, co powiedzieć...
Zamknij się i słuchaj! Jesteś tylko beznadziejnym, bezmózgim, żałosnym workiem gówna. Po cholerę to tu przyniosłeś?! Pamiętaj: jeśli chcesz ze mną pracować, zacznij używać tej swojej pustej głowy!
To się więcej nie powtórzy...
Więc... nikt w obozie poza mną i technikiem nie wie o twojej małej wpadce. Utrzymamy to w ten sposób... ale będziesz miał kolejne zadanie na swoich barkach. Ostatnie. Przykro mi, ale nie chcę mieć już z tobą nic wspólnego. I nie dostaniesz zapłaty.
Rozumiem... Co trzeba zrobić?
Jedyną szansą na odkupienie jest podłożenie tej rzeczy w pobliżu bandytów na stacji pojazdów i aktywowanie jej. Może będziemy mieli szansę uporządkować te szumowiny. Oczywiście nie obchodzi mnie, czy po prostu ich zestrzelisz, ale podrzuć urządzenie gdzieś w pobliżu, aby ich rodzaj nie wrócił.
Dobry plan.
A teraz zejdź mi z oczu! I pamiętaj: jeśli tego nie zrobisz, wszyscy będą wiedzieć, że to ty.
Rozumiem...
Uuugh...
Hej. Po co się tak wylegujesz?
Nie powinienem był pić. Czuję się jak gówno...
Gówno. Chciałem z tobą pogadać... To chyba nie najlepszy moment.
Możemy porozmawiać. Mogę cię o coś zapytać?
Co to jest?
I feel like my head's splitting in half... I can't be leading around rookies like this. Could you do it for me? There's money in it for you.
Why not? I'll do it!
This time around, our guy should be the one on watch duty, but you're still better off waiting until morning when the other soldiers are at their least vigilant. They're people and need their sleep too.
You got yourself a deal!
You supposed to be the guide? I thought he'd be bald. Where's the man I had a deal with?
The baldie's on vacation. I'm your guide. I won't say much: as soon as you descend, turn left and you'll see the village before reaching the fallen tree. Let's go.
Opa... You must be the guide, huh? I thought he'd be bald... Where's the one we had a deal with?
The baldie's on vacation. I'll be leading you. You ready to move?
You crazy? Can't see shit at night! We need to wait until the early hours. We'll be ready from four to eight, but after that, no-no. Can't risk it when the soldiers aren't all dozing.
Deal.
Didn't I make it clear we'll only go in the morning? What else do you want?
Okay, nothing.
So, you ready? Are we heading out?
I'm ready. You, on the other hand... Anyway, as soon as you get out of the tunnel, stick to the thorns and follow them up to the fallen tree, then turn left and head quietly toward the village. Let's move.
Shit, who the hell did you hand to me?! They walloped me in the face and took my backpack. At least those sons of bitches didn't find my money stash!
Oh, really? Damn. Should've gone myself.
Where can I find them now? I can't just leave my equipment like that. I needed it for the Garbage, and then this happens!
Chill, chill... They're greenhorns. I promise you. None of the experienced stalkers would've stolen from those who've been here a while... and that means they couldn't have gone far. Either look for them at the grain elevator or the farm. Don't worry - they didn't go farther than the Cordon. I'm afraid I can't help you search for 'em - can barely stand on my own two legs... I should stop drinking so much...
I'll try. But how will I do it without my equipment?
All I can give you is my pistol. Sorry.
It'll do.
Don't kill us. Please, just don't kill us!
Alright, you bastards. And you're damn lucky I'm not putting bullets between your eyes! But remember: if I see you street thugs again, I won't play so nice!
We get it! Your stuff is in the box over there, in the corner! May the Black Stalker watch over you!
What Black Stalker? You idiots have been listening to too many legends!
I found those parasites. Thanks for the pistol! Here, have it back.
Not at all, bro! I told you they wouldn't go far. Did you get your stuff? I hope you didn't have to use the gun?
I took one out to teach 'em a lesson. The other one stayed at the farm. Little son of a bitch is shitting his pants right now... Whatever, he'll know not to rob stalkers again!
I took 'em out to make an example. To think they'd stand up to us...
I didn't touch them. We split up peacefully.
Way to go! You did what a stalker should've done! Here, you can have this. I don't have use for it here.
You shouldn't have done that, Axe... Who knows what motivated them when they robbed you. Maybe they had a hard time. After all, they didn't kill you, even if they had the chance... Alright, well, that's your business. I won't judge.
Oh, man... Thanks! And I wanted to talk to you about something...
Let's just forget about that. I wanted to talk to you about something.
Oh, I know what you did. Sidorovich told me.
That cocky...
Don't worry. No one else will know. And I don't blame you for it - we learn by doing.
Well, thanks. I'm preparing to go to the Garbage. Got nothing else to do here, so I guess it's time for goodbyes.
Oh, come on... "Goodbyes"... We'll meet up again and get shit-faced again!
Of course. Now, see you!
I found those parasites. Thanks for the pistol! Here, have it back.
Not at all, bro! I told you they wouldn't go far. Did you get your stuff? I hope you didn't have to use the gun?
I took one out to teach 'em a lesson. The other one stayed at the farm. Little son of a bitch is shitting his pants right now... Whatever, he'll know not to rob stalkers again!

Way to go! You did what a stalker should've done! Here, you can have this. I don't have use for it here.
You shouldn't have done that, Axe... Who knows what motivated them when they robbed you. Maybe they were living rough. After all, they didn't kill you, even if they had the chance... Alright, well, that's your business. I won't judge.
Oh, man... Thanks! And I wanted to talk to you about something...
Let's just forget about that. I wanted to talk to you about something.
Let me guess: I heard Sidorovich is out of work... so you're going for the Garbage.
Yeah. By the looks of it, there's nothing more for me here.
Then I can only wish you luck and thank you for all the great times we've had together.
Guess it's time for goodbyes...
Oh, come on... "Goodbyes"... We'll meet up again and get shit-faced again!
Of course! Now, see you!
Buddy, could you give me a hand?
Hey. What are you doing here?
Imagine this: I'm walking down the road and I see a car! Looks unused, too! Might've been the army that left it here - they tried starting it, but there's no gas, which is why they left it.
Leave that hunk of junk here. What are you gonna do with wheels in the Zone?
I have a few plans. Listen, could you help me out?
Sorry, but I ain't pushing it all the way to the village.
No need for pushing. Our technician in the village has some gas. You run off there while I keep watch over the car. I'll share a little present with you too! Deal?
Okay, fine. I'll go get the gas for you. Hope the present is worth it...
Nah, man. You think I have nothing else to do than to run marathons for your gas? I'm off.
Okay, sure! You go about your business! I'll just wait here for some good soul!
Mikhalych, you don't have a can of gas, do you?
Why ask? What do you want with it?
This one guy found a nice car, but it's empty and needs refueling. Could you hand over a canister?
Well, I'll be! The guy finds a car and I'm supposed to spare my gas for him just like that?... Why don't you feed my pockets with a thousand and it's a deal, alright?
Ugh... Here's your grand, you cheapskate.
Damn it, I don't have that much. Wait a moment and I'll be back with the money.
Well, screw you then! I'll manage somehow.
Gas is a rare commodity around here, so I hope you understand my position as a "cheapskate"... Here's your canister. There ain't much inside, just so you know.
Alright. Have a good day.
I'm here about the gas.
Got the money?
I do.
Whoops. Looks like I'm short of it again...
I don't. Forget about this whole thing.
Here's your canister. There ain't much inside, but you'll manage.
As you wish. Come by if you need anything else.
Good luck...
God damn...
Hey, talk to me! What's wrong? Get up, man - the village is right around the corner!
I ain't feeling good... Agh...
Gimme your hand. Try standing up, nice and easy...
Buddy, I'm more than busy right now. Come by some other time.
Hey, pal, I'm busy. Come by later. Go see Sidorovich and don't bother me.
As you say.
So, did you get the gas?
I got. Here.
Not yet. Wait here.
Sorry, but I changed my mind.
Oh, hell yeah! Great job, man! Here, you deserve it!
Damn, thanks! What are you gonna do with this ride now?
Well, screw you, then! I'll find someone else.
Good luck...
I'll wait here for a friend of mine and decide with him. But you did your job, and that's what matters. Alright, bye, man.
Good luck to you!
Shit, this hurts like a...!
What happened? Who did this to you?
Damn bandits did it! They saw me... and opened fire instantly!
Hold on. I'll take a look at your wound.
They tried starting the car before they figured out it was out of gas, then went back to their camp to get some. I'm pretty sure it's at the Garbage...
You got lucky there. The bullet went right through, but it looks like no vital parts were hit. I tried closing the wound, but you need to get back to the village before they return.
I'll try getting back... You be careful too. Don't let 'em catch ya.
You taking the canister with you? I don't need it.
Oh yeah, that's right... If you deal with the bandits, I think I can get back here to the car. Gimme the can... They'll be here any minute, so keep 'em busy - I can't move that fast... Almost forgot, here you go for the trouble!
Thanks! See you around, man... if the Zone is kind to us.
Shit, man... Hurts like a son of a gun!
What happened? Where'd those bastards go?
Yeah, good question... They went to get gas after they realized the car's empty. They opened fire instantly and thought they got me... They'll be back in a second. We gotta hurry... Thanks for coming here, stalker. I won't forget it.
Of course I'd help. How are you? Can you walk? Let me see. The bullet went right through - you're lucky. But you need to get back to the village either way.
Don't worry. I'll get back... Thanks again. Here's for responding to my call. Good luck.
Don't mention it. Anyone would've done the same. See you around, man... if the Zone is kind to us.
Don't tell me we scared you? Come on over - we don't bite.
Well, you know... was just walking by. Big exo guys walking around the Cordon...!
Nah, guys. Maybe later.
Nothing out of the ordinary. We got back from an incursion not long ago. This place is good for relaxing and resting up.
Your gear sure is neat... So where exactly are you returning from?
You won't believe it anyway, but we were at the Chernobyl power plant. Radiation there is sky-high, so we went back. Something is hiding behind that radiation, and we're thinking about how to slip through to find out. Might be artifacts... who knows.\n \nThere actually used to be five of us: I'm Brute, and the boys by the fire are Gravedigger and Guerilla. The other two were Warhorse and Mute... rest their souls. The former took a Monolith bullet back at the power plant, and he collapsed right in the middle of a psy-field we were running from. If not for that, he might've still been alive... The latter went missing two months ago. He told us he was heading to the army warehouses on a scouting trip, and we haven't seen him since. That's two months we haven't heard anything from him. My best bet is that he kicked the bucket... but while Warhorse had no chance, we can't say anything about Mute for sure.\n \nIf you find him or his remains, let me know. It's important to us.
Of course! What a story, too. How is the CNPP? Anything valuable there?
Not a damn thing! You'd best steer clear of that place, pal. Beats the hell out of me what's waiting for you there - we lost one friend, and we sure as hell aren't going back to that hellish place to lose another.\n \nOn the other hand, there are artifacts there as far as the eye can see. The biggest threats are the Monolith and the psy-emissions, but there are placed where you can bypass them as long as you have the right equipment. 'Cause man, do we want to get there...\n \nHey, you ever heard about the Wish Granter? They say it's some kind of glowing rock that apparently fulfills your wishes. It's supposed to be located in the heart of the Zone: in the CNPP, under the Sarcophagus. On one hand, it's a bunch of crap, but on the other, what else could the Monolith guys be guarding? That means there's still a reason to check in there. Who might you be yourself, by the way?
Ah, I go by "Axe." Nice to meet you. I also want to see the CNPP - must be full of artifacts despite the dangers! I've heard about that Wish Granter... Even though I don't really believe in it, I have the wish to be there! Alright, sorry for all the questions... it's just that hardened stalkers like you aren't around every corner. Thanks for the info. It was nice talking to you.
Just keep in mind, Axe, that whenever you feel like it, come to us and we'll find some decent work for you.
Absolutely. Thanks again.
Oh, hey, Axe. You here on business, or?
This area is off limits, stalker.
But I need to go there.
Tough luck. Unless you *really* need to go, then the price is five hundred.
Here you are.
I don't have that kind of money.
Now listen up. We'll pretend for a moment it's nothing but mosquitoes and butterflies around here. What happens beyond this point is your own damn business.
Then go back where you came from and get it. And don't you try and sneak past us, you hear? Trust me, it's not worth dying for.
I understand. Thank you, commander.
Thanks a lot...
Go on, get out of here!
I'm leaving. Don't get worked up.
Where do you think you're going, stalker?! This area is off limits. Either you pay double or you go right back to where you came.
I'm not looking for trouble, commander. Here's the money.
I don't have the money.
Screw you!
Alright. Now go on and get out of our sight.
I'm going.
What do you want?
Hi there! Is the coast clear?
Hey! What can I tell you... Military's surveilling the area non-stop. Best not make any noise.
You're right about that. I almost walked right into them the day before. Barely got out.
You got lucky.
So do you always keep watch here?
No, we take turns. You want in?
I'd rather not right now. Got enough work as it is. What about you? You didn't come to the Zone to ???, did you?
Of course not. I'll earn some money and experience, and then I'll give my shot at traveling into the Zone. I'm just dreaming to see the CNPP with my own eyes... Just thinking about it takes my breath away!
Never been there myself either. I'd also want to go there.
Getting there will be quite the challenge, considering all the Zone's dangers...
We knew what we were getting into. I'm going now. Later!
Bye.
Are you a local? I was here last year, but I don't remember you.
I mostly wander around the Cordon with my guys. We used to set up camp by the bridge and rest there, but now the military's back, so it's a bit harder these days. Passerbys have two options: pay the military or go through the tunnel with the anomalies. Neither one is really that compelling, so we're staying here for the moment.
I see. You been beyond the Cordon? What do you think about those areas?
A few times. Sidorovich once sent me to deliver artifacts to the scientists at Agroprom. He paid well, and I had a nice little chat with the scientific figures... I never got bored, so to speak. Still, it's better not to go to those parts without a reason, because you can end up in the wrong place, catch a stray bullet or run into any of the Zone's many creations...
What creations?
Hell, I don't even know what to tell you! A partner told me there's some weird stuff going on at the Duty outpost: some mystical entity appears before them at night. I don't believe in such stories, but when you hear such things from the horse's mouth, it's hard to even describe the feeling... All kinds of thoughts start storming you about what it could be.
Probably just tall tales, but who knows. If I go there, I'll make sure to ask.
They're not just stories. I was their at their outpost, and there's definitely some oddity there. The entity itself is harmless and appears when everyone's headed off at night.
Up to you whether you believe it or not. I'm just telling you what I've heard.
Well, now! I should stop going on excursions. The Cordon's got a balance to it: there's not much money, but you're not likely to die or lose your brains.
I'll keep it in mind.
You're right about that. I'm going now - had enough stories for today. Bye.
Hey there! I heard you were planning to cross the embankment. Could you help me with something?
What's it about?
A friend of mine, Kiryukha, went looking for loot on the other side and went missing. I don't know what might've happened to him... I hope he just found something useful and went to the Bar to make money off of it - he's like that. If you happen to find him on the way, let me know, 'kay?
I can't promise you anything, but I'll tell you if I see him.
Find anything out about Kiryukha?
Not yet.
I'm sorry, but your Kiryukha's dead...
How? What happened?
Before his last breath, he told me he was tricked to the abandoned grain elevator by a talking flesh. I fell for it too, and barely dealt with it. Good thing there was only one... but behind the embankment, in the lowlands, there's a whole pack of them. See where I'm going?
What? What do you mean?
I mean that a number of our boys have fallen to those scum - there's a whole heap of bodies at the grain elevator. If we don't take them out, sooner or later, they'll head to the village. You get me? We need to tell Fanatic about this.
He's on a trip with a few stalkers. Said he'd be back in a couple of days.
So that means we'll do this without him. I imagine they'll be attacking the camp anytime now. Got any men who can help?
I think so, yeah. They all knew Kiryukha. They won't turn us down.
Alright. That means we're going. Kiryukha said he saw them by the embankment, though I don't know how many there are. Godspeed!
Alright. That means we'll go in the morning. Kiryukha said he saw them by the embankment, though I don't know how many there are. Godspeed!
I'll take a moment to prepare, then we'll go.
Ready? Can't wait to take revenge on those things.
Yeah. Let's go.
Not yet. Wait a moment.
Shit, man... Can't believe we got this far. Any more and I would've messed myself. You doing okay? We need to go back to the village, tell everyone the beasts are done with... and give our boys a burial while we're at it.
This is some real vague shit... Let's go back to the village.
Okay, we're here. Time to rest up from what we just went through... Thanks a lot for the help, stalker. If it wasn't for you, I would've remained there... This is yours now.
Thanks. Don't let it get to you.
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.
Shoot.
How about some other time?
I see there's one less house in the village. How did it get burned down? I spent a few nights in it last year, and now all that's left to hang around in is the dull basement.
Best you don't ask. A few guys and I had to leave for a couple of days while the rest stayed here. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and trusted them not to make any trouble... but I was wrong. Those bastards lit a campfire in front of the house, and by evening, they were all drunk and out of control. I don't know the details, but the house burned down by nighttime. Good thing the army didn't catch up - the smoke must've been invisible in the dark. You wouldn't believe the stench all over the village when I got back... I thought I'd die right then and there just from breathing it. Now there's no way I'm leaving for that long - who knows what these daredevils will come up with?
Well, that's one hell of a story. Is there really no one here to keep order besides you?
I wish... I look at those slinks and they all keep quiet. I ask, "Who burned down the house?" They say, "We all did it." Try giving them your trust after that.
What a tight community. Everybody takes responsibility. The fellowship of the Zone!
One wish to rule them all... Okay, fellow, you go do your thing.
Hey there. I recently became the new owner of this little device, but it's in quite a sorry state. Could you take a look at it?
A 5.45 Groza? Now, *this* is a rare sample... Where did you get this thing? I've only ever seen it in enemy hands, and here you are bringing me one... a unique sample, too! Even if it's my first time with this gun, with a bottle, I'll make it do wonders in a couple days. Though, nothing in this world is free, you know?
How much?
No, money's not what I need right now. Got enough of it that I don't even know how to spend. Rather, I need a few work materials. I had a stalker that used to bring me those - Seryoga Koncheklyga - but he went missing about a week ago. According to him, you can get everything at the Garbage in some underground vault under the hangar. You've already seen those places, so take a look there and bring me everything you find.
Do I have a choice?
What a coincidence - I've already been there. Looks like I wasn't carrying around this stuff for nothing. Will this do?
What a coincidence - I've already been there. Looks like I wasn't carrying around this stuff for nothing. Will this do? Oh, and I found that stalker too. Dead... He's in the Electro in the woods.
I don't think so. But if you don't really need the gun, I could buy it off you for three and a half. Don't look at me like that... This piece is trashed.
Well, now! Just what I need. Okay, you can leave your piece here - I'll have it done in a day or two. I'll message you.
Damn... Thanks for telling me. Here I was thinking he'd given up on my request. Now, about the stuff... Okay, this is just what I need! You can leave your piece here - I'll have it done in a day or two. I'll message you.
No, that's too cheap. I'll get the materials for you.
Don't feel like running around and digging up junk for you. Take the thing.
Great! I'll be waiting. Talk to you soon.
Leave that half-gun here while it's out of killing condition and head to where we've agreed. I'll do everything properly.
Okay, here's your money. Good luck in the Zone.
Careful so you don't break it for good. I'll be back soon.
See you.
So, did you fix it?
It sure wasn't easy, but I did it. Here you go. Now, about our deal... Where are the materials I asked for?
Here's your junk. My whole backpack stinks from having to lug it around.
Here's your junk. My whole backpack stinks from having to lug it around. Oh, and I found your stalker... Looks like the poor guy wandered into an Electro in the woods.
Okay... just what I need. Here's your gun - you won't find anything like in the Zone, trust me. I even tried it out on some of the dogs, and it's a killing machine.
Damn! What happened, did he run into any of the mutants or roll around with a bullet in his head? Ugh, whatever... Here's your gun - you won't find anything like in the Zone, trust me. I even tried it out on some of the dogs, and it's a killing machine.
Thanks a lot. This might even get me to the center of the Zone!
Yeah. Wasn't easy, but I managed it in one afternoon. Take it.
Look who it is! And without an escort, too!
Hey, man! Haven't seen you in a while.
And here I thought our Axe was gone for good over there. So tell me, how's life beyond the Cordon?
Coming back here is like going on vacation. There's so much happening there. Everything's different...
Told you! You could've just stayed here and not bust your balls. Though I see you've got a new suit. You're coming up in the Zone!
Told you! You could've just stayed here and not bust your balls. And your suit's all battered - looks like you haven't come up in the Zone quite yet!
Told you! You could've just stayed here and not bust your balls. You don't even carry a suit anymore - something happen to you, little Axie?
Yeah, right! Crawling into anomalies...
I'll get a decent suit. Don't worry.
I'll have a decent suit sooner or later. Don't you worry about it.
Man, I would've loved to chat with you, but we have a little problem. You've got some experience under your belt now - I was hoping you could help.
What's it about?
Go see Fanatic. He'll tell you.
Go see Fanatic. He'll tell you. Oh, almost forgot! Here's your pay for the soldier.
Okay.
Great, thanks! I'll go talk to Fanatic.
Hey there!
Yurok told me something happened.
That's right. We sighted a mercenary group not far from here. Heck knows what they're looking for, but they've been stationed there for two days now, and I don't like it. They even tried taking over our camp once, but it didn't work out for them... thanks to this one stalker who helped us.
Best we don't stir up the hornet's nest, huh? They're just standing around.
That's exactly the thing - they're not just standing around. Three stalkers from the village broke camp where they decided to position themselves. They were coming back from a trip with loot and decided to sit by the fire and have a meal. Then the mercs showed up and opened fire before we even opened our mouth. Only one of them got away, and he barely made it to the village with his wounds.
Did he survive?
Unfortunately, no. But the last thing he told me was that the mercs were dead serious about their business. The whole village is on alert - everyone's too afraid to leave. We need to do something. We don't know how long they're planning on staying here or what their plans are, and while they're here, we're not safe.
What do you suggest?
I suggest we use the element of surprise and attack them. There are only five of them. If we head up to their camp quietly, we could easily drop 'em. I have no one else to take with me on this mission - it's just me and Yurok. The other greenhorns won't go even if you hold a gun at them.
The three of us against a mercenary camp? Sounds dangerous.
If we bring the rookies, we're shooting ourselves in the foot. We have two advantages on our side: the element of surprise and a rocket launcher that some stalkers just stole from the army. We'll approach quietly and make blast those bastards. I have past experience with this - a group of mercenaries wanted to throw us out before, but we stood our ground.
You never change. Any problem comes up, you deal with it the explosive way.
The only way to do it! Are you with us?
Of course I'm with you. No way I'd leave you hanging. What's the plan?
We wait for sunrise and move out.
Understood.
Ready?
Ready. Let's head out.
I don't like this..
Where'd they go?
No idea.
Maybe they're dug in below ground somewhere?
I don't see anything on the ground. What I did see was a bright flash.
What are we gonna do?
The only thing we can do: get back to camp. I don't know who these people are and where they disappeared, but I'm getting the creeps from this place. Let's just bury the guys along the way first instead of leaving them here.
Let's go...
Well, that's how it goes. I hope they won't show up anymore. Still, Sidorovich needs to know of this - he'll think of something if his own skin is at stake.
If anything else comes up, let me know. I'll always help my old friends.
You stay in touch too! Thanks for the help. We owe you one. Where are you headed?
To Novoshepelychi. Гot a job there. I actually came here to find out a path to there, and I had a free moment turn up just now. What can you tell me?
It's an interesting place - I've been there a few times. The road there is near the mutant lair you and Fanatic blew up. Follow it ??? and keep to the right. You'll end up at the collapsed railway tunnel, where you can start going down and enter Novoshepelychi. Once you go back, don't bother climbing up - you can go underground through the tunnel, which was once used for some technical purposes. When you're at the Cordon, go out through the door. For some reason, it's locked from the outside, which is why you have to take different paths. Now, be careful... It's more dangerous there than at the Garbage.
Thanks. Good luck to you here. I'll meet up with you soon!
We meet again.
You son of a bitch. You opened fire! I had no use for your damn artifact!
I don't see it in your backpack. Where is it?
If I tell you, how will I know you'll let me go?
We're good guys when listened to and when we're understood the first time. So we'll do it like this: you tell us the place you hid the goods, we grab it, and you continue your own path. What was it you were doing again? Shooting mutants? Gathering artifacts? That's exactly what you'll keep doing, like nothing happened.
I'll only tell you when I'm in safety, far from here. You told me yourself what you're capable of. If I lie, you'll find me anyway.
Buddy, try digging up something here. I've got no luck. Either I'm doing something wrong or my detector's broke...
Let's see.
That prick ran off with all the artifacts! Now we're left with jack all... Whatever. We'll go somewhere else.
Yeah? What do you want?
Better luck next time.
Bye.
Hello.
I'm listening to you.
Bye.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Axe.
Glad to see you!
Hey, pal!
Oh, it's you, Axe! What brings you here?
Need anything, brother?
I found the body of a stalker at the Garbage. His name was Mishgan. Here's a note he had on him. He asked me to take his PDA to the rookie village.
Shit... Mishgan! I told him to stay out of that damn Garbage! How'd it happen?
He needed help freeing his comrades from bandits. Our odds weren't great, so I turned him down. Mishgan whacked me in the head and went off on his own... When I woke up, I found three bodies at the vehicle graveyard: it was him and two of his friends. The bandits were gone by then.
No idea.
I didn't expect you to let down a fellow stalker! With your help, he would've freed his friends and everyone would've come out alive. You really chickened out?... Yeah, that stuff ain't like doing errands for Sid at the Cordon...
Real shame about him. He was a good comrade for everyone the village. Now he'll be rotting with all the garbage...
Well, that's how things happened.
I'm sorry about it.
Either way, thanks for telling us. Here are some spare supplies I've got. You could use it.
Thanks. Until next time.
Hey! Got any missions?
Hello there! I do. I'd say you've performed well, so I hope I won't regret trusting you with this task...
Hello there. Something's been coming up: the army and scientists were supposed to carry out some field research here at the Cordon. I wanted to ask you to see where they go, but they were having some problems at the checkpoints... a shootout of some kind. So right now I can only offer you small-time work.
I'm all ears.
There's a scientist team that's soon arriving at the military checkpoint. I don't know what the hell they're after, but I do know that they're about to depart with a military escort to do some field research.
This one stalker, Puck, sent me a message not long ago. Not far away from here, by the Electro tunnel, there's a lot of mutant scum that needs cleaning out. Will you do it?
What field research?
Of course. Need to earn cash somehow. I'm not planning on staying at the Cordon.
There's nothing there. I literally just cleaned the place out.
That's what I want to find out. Maybe they're cooking something up against the stalkers, and that means my business will take a hit. I need to know everything. You'll be tracking them, but be careful about it. See where they go and what they'll be doing, then report to me. Now, get moving! We'll settle up later.
Then get to work. Make sure you clean out every single beast.
Great work, then. Here's your reward. You're free to go - I have nothing more to offer you.
Got it. I'll do the best I can.
Thanks. And goodbye, Sid.
Sid, things have happened... Basically, all field research was canceled, and I barely made it away from the army alive.
What do you mean, canceled? That's good on the one hand... but on the other, your parents must be ashamed of you. Soon enough, they might come back and carry out their experiments, and you, of course, won't be at the Cordon by then. I'll have to find someone else.
Well, what can you do...
Here's for the delayed work. Door's right behind you.
Goodbye, Sid.
Sid, the eggheads spotted me. I barely made it out alive. That field research will definitely be delayed for some time.
If anyone finds out, you'll have some serious problems on your hands with your reputation. Don't expect me to trust you with anything more serious from now on.
Just don't tell anyone about it, Sid. Let's say I dealt with any problems in advance that they would've caused it. C'mon, gimme a reward!
You're quite bold, aren't you, stalker? A reward's not what you need... no, you need a good smack on the head. Now, get out.
Bye, Sid...
Don't shoot! What do you need?
Things went the way they did. What are you doing here? Where are you headed?
We were meant to test our new device not far from here. Just don't hurt us, please! Take the device, anything, just don't shoot!
Don't make a move until I leave.
Don't make a move until I leave.
Don't shoot, please! I'll give you everything!
I'm not here for your belongings. Why are you here? Where were you heading?
We were ordered to test a new piece of equipment. It's one device. Here, take it if you need it - just don't hurt us, please!
Wait here before I leave. Don't even think about making a move.
Wait here before I leave. Don't even think about making a move.
Just don't kill us!
Please, don't shoot!
Just don't shoot us, please!
I beg of you, don't shoot!
Please don't kill me!
Shut your mouth and don't move.
Enough screaming. Stay still.
Enough whining. Shut it.
You might want to shut that mouth.
Stop screaming if you want to go home in one piece.
Here's the scientist device. I still don't get what this is.
Okay, let's see what we've got...
Any luck with it?
Yeah, yeah. Just a second...
The suspense is killing me... What's it do?
Shit, the thing somehow has an impact on monsters! Help the guys fend off the attack - I'll turn off this junk!
Yeah! Okay! I'm off!
Did you fight 'em off?!
We did! So, any luck in turning that thing off?
Yeah, thank god. Barely managed!
I don't know what it is, but that thing lured the mutants over here. As soon as you turned it off, they literally disappeared!
Well now... Listen, I have no use for devices like this. How about this: you find a way to plant this thing by the bandits at the vehicle station and I give you a suit in return. What do you say about that? The stalkers and I will be grateful to you!
Soon enough, I'm gonna need to leave the Cordon, so a new suit will be just right for me. Give me the device and I'll give it a shot.
I planted the device there. Didn't think I was gonna get out alive...
Good work, stalker. Here you go: a brand new stalker suit, as promised. Good luck outside of the Cordon. If you need anything fixed, you know who to turn to.
Thanks, Mikhalych! See you next time!
I tracked down the scientists - they had a military escort. They arrived at the floating village by the vehicle station. One of them went through the teleporters to get to the top, and he planted some device there.
What kind of device?
I got that by now. Why in the seven hells did you bring that thing to the village? You take me for a complete idiot? There's never been a single mutant attack like that here before!
No idea.
Well, you know... it just happened like that.
Okay, here you go for the trouble. I hope it's nothing meant to cause problems for the stalkers. Right now, I've got no serious work, so you're free.
I've dealt with a lot of mongrels in my time, Axe, but out of all of them, you're the one that'll be remembered. Get out of my sight. This is for the work, but don't expect me to trust you with anything serious again.
See you, Sid.
Bye then, Sid...
A stalker named Puck told me that the scientists and army arrived at the floating village by the vehicle station, and that one of the eggheads went through the teleporters to get to the top, where the house is. There, he installed some kind of device.
I see. What kind of device?
I'd like to ask you something. Why in the seven hells did you bring that thing to the village? You take me for a complete idiot? There's never been a single mutant attack like that here before!
No idea.
Well, you know... it just happened like that.
Okay, here you go for the info. I hope it's nothing meant to cause problems for the stalkers. Right now, I've got no serious work, so you're free.
I've dealt with a lot of mongrels in my time, Axe, but out of all of them, you're the one that'll be remembered. Get out of my sight. This is for the work, but don't expect me to trust you with anything serious again.
See you, Sid.
Bye then, Sid...
The dogs are dealt with. There won't be anything there anytime soon.
Excellent. Here's for the work. Right now, though, I can't offer you anything more.
Thanks, Sidorovich. Until next time.
What do you need?
Afternoon, captain! My name's Zhuravlyov - I'm a military stalker. I'm preparing to visit the village nearby, and I have a few questions.
I'm listening, Zhuravlyov.
Have you seen the stalker on this photograph?
I can tell you with certainty that he hasn't been among our detainees. So you've got a bone to pick with him - is that why you came to these parts? Did he do anything special?
Not quite sure yet. I'll ask Sidorovich - maybe he can tell me something. I'll talk to your detainees about him too.
Not quite sure yet. I'll ask Sidorovich - maybe he can tell me something.
Just be careful about your inquisitions, and above all, don't touch him. We need that man alive. Understood?
Just be careful about your inquisitions, and above all, don't touch him. We need that man alive. Understood? You'd also be better off without military wear. There's a crate with clothing by the cells where the detainees are held - grab what you need from there and leave what you don't need. Just remember that some of it was taken from dead trespassers... I'm joking, I'm joking.
It'll be alright. Don't worry.
It'll be alright. Don't worry. Thanks for the tip; I'll go try on the clothing.
Hey, buddy! Help me out?
What's the matter?
Please, help me get out of here!
Why should I? You've broken the law and entered forbidden territory. I'm not one to decide your fate.
We didn't do anything bad! Yes, we broke through, but we haven't killed anyone and we haven't taken any artifacts out of the Zone! We have other goals here, and we're no criminals.
And I wonder what those might be? I thought the only thing stalkers are here for is coin.
We're looking for a man. A good man. Should even say he's one of the best to set foot here.
You know, I'm looking for a man too. You help me, I help you. Sound good?
Of course!
Here's a picture. Ring any bells?
I know him, I know him! That's... His name is Axe! He hung around in the village and then went off to the center of the Zone!
Got any of his contact info? How can I get in touch with him and find him?
I don't have it. I haven't seen him in a long time.
So you can't tell me where to find him?
All I know is that he went north of the Cordon. So, could you put in a good word for me and my brother? We don't know anything else!
Well, we had a deal... You haven't helped me, so I can't help you. Sorry.
I'll help you find him - just get me out of here!
What's your name?
Name's Shimmer.
Wait here. I'll come back if I need your help.
Talked to the prisoners?
Talked to the prisoners? Does the clothing suit you alright?
I haven't found out anything new, unfortunately. I'll go see Sidorovich.
The clothing fits, thank you. As for the prisoners, I haven't found out anything new, so I'll go see Sidorovich.
Just keep your ID with you so you don't get taken by our boys.
Of course. What will we do about the detainees?
What do you think? As per all laws of mother Ukraine, they'll end up in court... Actually, no! First they'll do some work for the benefit of our checkpoint - we need a fresh coat of paint for the garage and new plastering for the workshop. After that, we can have those boys deported. What, does your facility also need extra manpower?
We need brains, not muscle. I might need this one stalker named Shimmer soon. Don't do anything rash to him.
Noted. If he doesn't get high on paint, it'll be alright. But remember: you have two days. After that, they'll be escorted to the outside.
Understood. Thank you, captain.
What do you want?
Just dropped by for supplies and to trade for info.
What makes you think I'll share any of that with you? I don't remember you from here.
What else is there to do here? These areas are mapped out down to the last inch. The north, on the other hand... that's where I want to go.
Judging by your wear, your "north" goes as far as the pig farm by the bridge. Hah!
Still, I don't know anything about you. To tell you the truth, I wouldn't want to, either.
Wouldn't want to stain my exo in the Cordon mud... and your rookies might turn into drooling fools.
Can we quit being snarky and talk like normal people?
Fair point! So, what do you want?
Alright. What do you need?
I need information on a stalker. I take it that's the most valuable currency here, so I have something to offer in return.
Yeah? And what might that be?
Does information on Yantar interest you?
Not at all! I've sent three teams there, and not a single one has come back alive!
If I offer you a detailed map of the vicinity, the chance of your next team returning will be higher... and there might be profit in it for you personally. Interested?
What would you like in return?
I'm looking for the stalker on this photo. He seems to go by "Axe." Know him?
Ah... Yeah, I know that face... Okay, hand me the map and I'll tell you where he is. But I don't know anything else about him, nor do I care. 
And that means...? Is your information on his position accurate?
It is. Give me the map!
I'll send it on your PDA.
Suits me! So... You know about the collapsed railway bridge nearby, right?
Of course I have.
If you want to find him, that's where you want to go. And don't ask me about details. Better yet, you and I never had this conversation. Now, get going. Chop-chop.
Right, then. Have a nice day.
What are you hanging around here for?
Just stopping by for Sidorovich. I need to see him.
So what are you waiting for? Just don't hang around here!
Understood.
Well, why are you walking around here?
Relax. I need to see Sidorovich on some business.
Then go see him. The bunker's behind you. Don't think of doing anything without our permission.
See you.
What do you need here?
I need to see Sidorovich on some business. Don't work yourself up.
Sidorovich is on the other side. Watch yourself while you're here.
Bye.
Listen, pal. I don't care whoever you are in that getup of yours - you'd better stay away from here. We don't need people like you.
Keep it quiet... I'm here to see Sidorovich.
Don't even think about meeting Sidorovich - who knows what you've got planned... We've already messaged him, and if you try anything up here, you'll just get yourself shot.
I see, then... Wait. If I can't see him, maybe you could tell me where to find the stalker on this photo?
Wait, that's... Uh, no, I don't know him. Get going.
Okay, then. Bye.
Buddy, I don't know who think you are in those shoddy clothes, but I'm telling you: get out of here.
Not so loud. I'm just here to see Sidorovich on business.
You've no chance of seeing him - he's already been notified. Don't try anything around here... or we'll get your head straight one way or another.
Hold up... If I can't see the trader, could you tell me where to find the stalker on this photo?
Dunno anything 'bout him. Now, clear off while you still can.
Bye, then.
Man, you better get out of here with that shady getup of yours. We don't need folks like you.
Let's not make any fuss. I'm here to see Sidorovich on business.
You think that's gonna work? He doesn't let in people like you, that's for sure. He's been notified about your arrival, so deal with it and don't expect to see him.
What the hell did you do that for? Then you be the one to help me out. Do you know the stalker on this photo?
First time I see him. Go about your business - don't bother the locals.
Bye.
Hey, Axe. Want something?
What've you got, Axe?
Well, I'm listening.
What do you want, traveler?
Come to get your stuff fixed?
Well, what do you need?
What are you looking for, newcomer?
And who have we got here?
What do you need?
What is it that you want? Go take a hike.
Don't bother me.
Don't get in my business, eh?
Would you kindly get lost?
Could you just not bother us?
Off with you. Don't bother us.
Beat it, buddy. Go find someplace else to wander about.
What else do you want? Go about your business.
Get moving. Don't bother us.
Go on, get out of here, and stay out of our way.
Is there perhaps any work for me at the Garbage?
There is. It's not your first day in the Zone, so you can handle it. Some of the boys at the Garbage need help with dealing with dogs and digging out some minor artifacts. All you have to do is cover their backs and they'll give you your cut when it's done.
Got it. Give me the coordinates.
Need something, friend?
Why are you sitting here all alone?
I screwed up.
So bad they exiled you?
No. Just a stroke of idiocy.
Tell me what happened.
You don't know? I scared the shit out of everyone! One night, the boys were drinking and I decided to play a prank on them when they were spread around their camps. You probably the same thing back in pioneer camp, eh? I shouted across the whole village: "Pseudodogs! Pseudodogs are attacking!" Everyone went full alert and took up positions. I couldn't keep myself from laughing like an idiot. I told them it was just a joke. After that, they gave me such a beating I couldn't even say a word in the morning. Now, nobody even wants to talk to me. My new name? "Jester." I'm the only one who laughed at my own prank... and they no longer believe a word I say.
What do you have to say about it?
That's what you get. Do you even know where we are, you idiot? This is no place for jokes, and your prank was worse than any real pseudodog out there!
Whatever I say, nobody will care. Though... I did notice something through my binoculars when I was on a task from Sidorovich by the embankment.
I know... but nobody believes me anymore! Though, right after that, I noticed something through my binoculars when I was on a task from Sidorovich by the embankment.
What exactly?
An artifact. I haven't seen its kind before, and whoever I asked said they didn't know anything. I'm too afraid to go by myself, though... It's right by the pig farm, and as you know, that place is full of flesh. Nobody wants to go with me, and the elder just laughs it off when I tell him about it.
You want me to come?
I don't feel like going anywhere with you, so buh-bye.
You serious?! I wouldn't mind you covering my back - you seem a lot more experienced than anyone else in the camp. Wanna go now?
Sure. Let's go find your artifact.
Bit later. I need to do something.
You're back. What is it?
Want me to come with you for that artifact?
Just passing by.
Ready to move?
Yeah, let's go.
Not yet.
Artifact's just around the corner. Ready?
Show the way.
Oh, that's rich... There really was a pack of pseudodogs here. Should've kept my mouth shut from the start! Let me at least look at the artifact.
Here, you earned it.
I'll take it for myself.
An interesting piece, for sure. I'm wondering about it's properties... I guess we should talk to Sidorovich about that. We heading back to camp?
Hey, that wasn't the deal! Have a heart and give it to me!
Yeah, let's go.
Piss off. The artifact is mine, and that's that.
Home, sweet home. I'll head into the camp to grab a few of my things and rest, then go to Sidorovich and sell them along with the artifact. Don't go too far - I'll contact you when I have a deal with him. You've earned half of the sum.
As you say. Just don't think about fooling me.
Why'd I do that? You're the first one to believe me after such a long time!
My advice to you, Jester, is to treat the other rookies to a drink and apologize to them.
Yeah, you're right. I'll treat them to something and apologize. Maybe they'll believe me after I tell them.
Good. Talk to you soon.
There's my man! Here's your reward for the whole ordeal. Thanks again!
Thanks, Jester... if they still call you that.
Don't worry 'bout it. It kind of stuck to me. Still, things are all good between me and the rest, as you can see. Wanna stay with us, maybe share a few tales?
Sorry, but it's time for me. Good luck, stalker... I hope you've learned your lesson.
Good to see you!
Hey, stalker?
What's up?
Bye.
See you later.
See you soon.
Good day. Something broken?
Hey! Need something fixed?
Need something upgraded or repaired? We got enough duct tape to patch the whole Zone up if need be!
Later.
I'll stop by sometime.
See you.
Mikhalych, could you upgrade my equipment?
Just barely. Need anything fixed, I'm your man; need an upgrade, I'll need the right tools. If you find any, I'll be able to fully mod your equipment, and I'll give you a good discount too. I need tools for basic work, tools for fine work and calibration tools.
Sounds interesting. If I find something, I'll try bringing it here.
I found tools for you.
Show me what you've got!
Tools for basic work.
Tools for fine work.
Calibration tools.
I have all the tools you're looking for.
I'll come by later.
Thanks! This'll make working with base mods easier.
Now this is something! Here's your reward.
This I can get by with! Now I can do the harder upgrades too. Here's your reward.
You're the man! Here's your reward. Count on a good discount as well.
Surprised?
I think you have a story to tell.
Yes, I do. My name is Alexey Kucherenko and it so happens that I work undercover in the Zone, infiltrating different groups, finding out all kinds of information about everything that happens in the Zone. I know... quite a bit. That's all I can say about myself. You know what I mean!
So you're a military. Then let's get to know each other properly, I'll...
I already know who you are. No, I'm not a military, but I co-operate with them on various issues as well. Let's just say that some people in the Zone know who I am other than the real Cluster kid, these people are few, but they are very useful people.
Well, if that's the case, then you know what's really going on and you can tell me.
Well, I do know some things, but I can't tell you much. And believe me, you live longer with less. Information... it can hurt...
All right, well, tell me something so it's not so vague, and where's Birdie?
About Birdie. Hmm. Well, I don't trust him all that much. As for the whole cargo thing, it's simple. There were two, maybe not brilliant, but quite clever scientists working on a psi emitter in the Zone. We've already talked to both of them in one way or another. But, as usual, one has goals, so to speak, for the good of mankind, and the other has... a more scientific interest. I'm doing my job, and as long as it matches your goals, we're partners.
Let me guess, when the goals don't align, you're gonna killed me?
What?! The military stuff doesn't apply to me. I meant we'll go our separate ways. And yes, let Birdie keep thinking Cluster is a real kid from the big road. 
By the way, why a bandit?
That's because so few people take it seriously. It's good to be underestimated! So, today I'm Cluster the bandit, and tomorrow someone else. Don't worry your head. Go to Smyshlov's, I'll come later, they haven't agreed with Birdie yet.
I'll ask you to open the door of this cage first.
Just a moment. But be warned, if you come here again, I may not be around.
Yes, sir.
Well, hello, stalker. Glad to see you're alive and well! Where's the device?
I'm sick of you guys asking the same question... at least now you have an answer. Turov has it. Understand? He set his people on us. And they took it away.
What?!
I've had a lot of people die because of this thing, and in the end, a couple of times I almost met my demise. What am I, an express delivery? One's asking for a device, one's asking for papers. Thank you for not pointing a gun at the back of my head! You're supposed to be men of science, the light of truth and all that, but like little children, you can't come to an agreement! What do you want?
I can see you want answers, my little dove. All right, let's start in order. When I was in my third year, I met Turov...
Professor, I don't want a retelling of your memoirs, I'm not a book publisher!
Okay, okay, I'll try to keep it short. In general, some time ago, my then comrade Turov and I planned to put our scientific concepts into practice. The Zone of Alienation became for us just a treasure trove of all kinds of topics, not only for dissertations, we could get the recognition of colleagues and even a Nobel Prize for studying the properties of the nature of the Zone, its anomalies, flora and fauna! But most of all we were interested in the so-called psi radiation, the nature of which still remains completely unsolved for us. As I thought at the time, we were building a portable psi emitter for therapeutic purposes. We wanted to cure those unfortunates whose brains had stopped functioning properly after exposure to psi radiation. So we built a mobile prototype psi emitter.
Go on.
Its task is not only to protect us from the Zone's psi radiation, but also, as I said, to have a therapeutic effect on zombified individuals. And we also planned to adapt our psi emitter for medical purposes outside the Exclusion Zone. The prototype can not only generate psi radiation, but also change its nature and adjust the power of the flow. Unfortunately, the further I went, the more Turov disagreed with me on many aspects of the development and application of the prototype. His interest was less humanitarian. Most of all, Turov was trying to find out how to use the transmitter to control the consciousness of not only animals and mutants, but also to control the consciousness of humans. In general, I stopped cooperating with Turov.
So your psi-device can be good or bad? It's just a matter of who uses it?
Unfortunately or fortunately. but yes, that's exactly what it is. Just don't divide the world into good and bad!
Yeah. you're the Old Guard. Can't make a deal?
Do I have to? But let me guess: Turov told you about the incident during the tests and that I'm really paranoid now? And then, probably, he told you that because of my paranoia I suspected a decent scientist, who stands for science and enlightenment, of using a psi emitter for manipulation for selfish purposes. And he sent me to get my papers so he could finally have a chance to cure me. Right?
Well... give or take, yeah.
You see, I was indeed hit by the radiation, but it had no negative effect on me. Quite the opposite. I'm as calm as I've ever been. And it was a two-way mental link. But still I had an obsessive thought about Turov not after the radiation, but when he began to spend more time on experiments on controlling the consciousness of living and non-living beings. Time goes by, and those who were exposed to the Brain Scorcher radiation are not getting younger either, and I think that they should be helped first of all. Turov, of course, explained his actions as creating a special stream of radiation to protect against monster attacks, so that the scientists could safely move around the Zone. Think about what I said!
Isn't it bad for every person in the Zone to have a device?
Of course it's good! Do you know what the dynamite was originally created for? That's just it, inventions can always be used for good purposes or vice versa, whether directly or indirectly. History knows many such examples. And our psi device will affect both monsters and humans, that's the problem! What happens if you are forced to go to the most dangerous places of the Zone against your will? Is it a good thing when you or any other person can be controlled with buttons and toggle switches? Do you want to be a puppet of an unknown puppeteer?
Are you guys out of your minds? Why are you doing this kind of development? You want to be a god?
You have no idea how much can be achieved! For me, this development was worth a lot, too much!
I don't care what she cost you!
You don't understand... this is my life's work.
Professor, listen to yourself! Turov has your device, the whole thing! I just don't understand why he needs your documents.
It's simple, the device is unstable even at short distances. And in order for it to work stably at a distance of several kilometres and not to lose power every five minutes, the core must be reinforced. And only I know how to do it.
To hell with you! And Turov and your device!
I understand. But you can't undo what you've done, and now you have to deal with the consequences. So give me some time to think this through. In the meantime, go to Sidorovich and get a set of psi-blockades. Tell him it's from me.
All right, Professor, just remember that without the papers we'll be killed, and maybe you too.
Hi, Sidorovich. I came to see you from the scientist, to get some drugs.
What kind of drugs is that?
ПPsi-blockade, several pieces.
Here you go, if that's the way it is. God forbid some scum comes to the village again because of you, I'll turn my head off. It was enough once.
Don't panic, old man, everything's under control. Take care.
So, do you have the drugs?
Yeah, I got it, here you go.
Not yet, I'll go to the trader.
Keep a couple of these. Might come in handy.
Thank you. I'm about to be hunted down by Turov's mate. So now would be a good time to tell me your plan.
I've given it a lot of thought. I won't give him the documents.
Professor, you know my situation. So if you don't give me the documents, I'll have to take them from you by force!
It won't be necessary. I'll go with you to see Turov.
We-e-ll... what are you up to?
Talking to an old colleague and friend. I want to talk some sense into him...
Professor, there must be something you're not telling me. You know that Turov can talk you out of this either with a gun or with your mobile emitter! Tell me directly what you want to do.
It's very simple, look at this. The core isn't just a screw, it's the brain of a living being that's been subjected to psi-influence. Or rather, a creature that died from a psi effect. So, depending on who the creature was when it was alive, the device operates on a certain spectrum of psi radiation. And that affects not only the strength and range of the effects, but also the...
Professor, we're stalkers, we're not scientists, we don't understand you!
Then why did you ask?
I was asking you for your plan of action, not how your... piece of metal.
It's not a piece of metal! It's almost a living being, capable of releasing, amplifying and channelling its psi energy to the right organisms with the help of the device!
Um... What do you have, a Pocket Controller in there?
Well, if you want to simplify it, so be it, but it's not a Controller. The point is that this creature is empathically aware of what's going on around it, but it's not fully trained, it doesn't understand what's "good" and what's "bad"!
So that's it... So this pocket one of yours, what's his name, is lying in a a glass cartridge and while the power is not connected, it sleeps, right? And when it's powered up, it stays awake and kills everyone around it? Например, тех сталкеров и наёмников?
Yes and no! A group of stalkers carrying a container were attacked by mutants. People were experiencing fear, pain, shock, and other negative emotions. Now, the creature in the container understands all of these emotions and experiences them. This range of emotions traumatises it. So in order to protect itself, it took control of part of the group of stalkers and eliminated them.... and the rest ran away with the сontainer, believing that the Сontroller was nearby!
So this nonsense poetically ended..... eliminated them. I mean, by the Сontroller.
No, I mean yes, but no!
Okay. Let's summarise. One of the three boxes contains a brain that can do things with psi radiation. I take it that's the core, right? And if that's the case, what can you change about it, this brain?
You asked for no details! Give me the radio, I'll talk to Turov.
Hurry up, please.
Exactly.
So what now?
Now let's go visit! I'll just grab a few things. And yes, we're leaving a few minutes apart. I'll go first, then you come out after me.
Come on, old man, come on. You'll never make it alone. All you know how to do is sit in your concrete boxes and poke at microscopes with tweezers! Do you even have a detector and a dosimeter?
I don't need detectors after the radiation I've received. I can feel them, the traps of the Zone. But I'll bring my machine gun.
I wouldn't mind some of that exposure too, cool! Anyway, old man, wait. We're not letting you go alone!
Why is that?
What if you decide to run away and we have to deal with Turov and Vizir. And I think they'll give us such lead pills that we'll be in trouble.
Don't worry, I'm a decent person and I keep my word!
Honesty is a good thing, but in the Zone it's a very vague concept. Let's go together, we'll protect you from all sorts of beasts, from four-legged and worse.
All right, have it your way.
That's the deal. Let's go.
I forgot to pick up a few things from the trader. I'll run back and forth. Don't be fooled, Cluster won't let you go alone.
Ready to Turov?
Let's move out.
Not yet.
О! Where are you from?
What surprises you?
Only a fool would wander into that arsehole of his own free will, or someone who... That's right! I got it! You work for Sidorovich too?
Yep.
Oh, you shouldn't have, bro!
What's the matter? Old man may grumble all the time, but he pays the money!
He does, yes. But it's pennies, considering how hard it's earned! Have you seen what a mess is going on in the sawmill? There's anomalies all over the place!
If you call yourself a stalker, go to the Zone. What's the problem?
Yes, but the old man could pay me extra for working in particularly dangerous places! Well, that's all right! I hear Beard pays good money for artefacts. We'll spend a couple of weeks here with the boys, buy some gear, and head north!
It's on Zaton! It's a long way from here...
It's not an option to stay here and work for pennies either. I'm ready to take risks, to climb anomalies, to carry radioactive stuff, but only if they pay me accordingly. And you won't get decent pay from this old man.
He's understandable, too. I hear it costs him a lot of money to be a carefree neighbour of the military. And good artefacts on Cordon rare.
I don't really care what it costs or who it costs. I'm speaking for myself, the risks in these parts are unjustifiable. That's why we're not going to stay on Cordon. And neither should you.
I was going further north, too, by the way. If you get to Zaton, maybe you can let me know how it's going?
All right.
It's a deal.
Shit, damn, maybe through the roof...
What are you muttering about?
Oh, man, it's my turn to go to the sawmill!
What sawmill?
Into this damn anomal sawmill! It's creepy in there.
Everything will be fine! Take the bolts and throw them around. Watch it. If you hear the sound of the detector, move in the right direction.
Yeah, man, I'm getting dizzy from having anomalies around.
Do not be afraid! First time?
In fact, yes...
Then it's clear... If it makes you feel any better, look at me. I've taken out a dozen artefacts and I'm still alive. Hands, feet, I'm fine.  I remember the first time I went to get a art. I was so nervous. I must have thrown 300 bolts into the anomaly before I got to the artefact! If I felt that the danger was near - I stopped, breathed, and then I only got further. It's all about taking your time. But imagine what joy and pride you would feel afterwards because of the first artefact you found!
Why don't you use a fucking stick to kick that artefact out of there?
What stick, what are you talking about?
Oh, shit!
Stop. Go get it. You've got the guys next to you, they'll help you if you need it. The anomalies on Cordon aren't too strong yet, they won't kill you right away. Maybe...
You go tell that to that corpse over there by the sawmill, man!
Who's that?
I don't know. He was already there when we got here.
Have you examined him visually?
Not really... It's like a camp. Food, water, ammunition. He must have had a snack before he died. And then death caught up with him. 
Right, so this was before the blowout, before there were any anomalies. Why else would he be picnicking in a place like this?
So what?
I don't think he died from the anomaly! There's fleshy creatures jumping around, they could have killed him! So, come on, go for it!
Damn, I'll just sit here for a bit and then I'll go!
Good luck to you!
What's that old stuff you got on the radio?
It's not old, kid! ЭThese are Soviet classics, songs of my youth! It used to be real music! And now. I don't even want to play it at all, it's just pop - no voice, no rhythm, just crap.
What can you tell me that's interesting?
If you go to the Garbage, be careful there. They say the bandits have lost their fear. You know the anomalous field behind the swamp? Forget it! They're there like they're fishing. And they're not fishing for artefacts! They don't want to go into the anomaly themselves, you see. They wait for some stalker to come and force him at gunpoint to get the artefact. Stinking ghouls! I'd like to beat them out of there, but who'd go?
Hi! Who are you?
Well, hello! My name is Wolf. What's up? Any questions for me?
You're just sitting here, alone, cooking something. It's unusual to see that away from a stalker camp.
It's relatively safe here now, and if anything happens, I'll always have a gun handy. I don't want to go to the camp yet. I haven't finished my work with Sidorovich yet, so I'm not going to the village yet.
What are you cooking? It smells good!
Pilaf. Want some? I'll boil the broth now, then I'll pour in the rice, and in an hour you can eat it!
Thanks for the offer, I'll think about it. It's rare for anyone to let themselves cook. It's all sausage and breads...
I'm sick of eating crap! You make yourself a whole cauldron of it and then you eat it for a week. But that's assuming you have Moonlight. It's so cold that it's a great substitute for a refrigerator in the Zone. Otherwise everything would have gone rotten long ago with this heat!
What happened that you started cooking?
And it all started with a prank assignment from Gordon the Cook. You've never heard of him? There used to be a stalker like that on Dumpster. I haven't heard from him in a while. Dead or something. Well, he gave me an assignment and promised to pay me handsomely. I had to buy all the necessary ingredients for pilaf from the Barman. I was so green at the time, I didn't realize he was joking. When I got to the bar, Barman looked at me like a fool, but surprisingly he had all the necessary products. I brought it all to Grodon's, he laughed, gave me money, but wouldn't take it. I did not think long and cooked pilaf. The stalkers at the Depot ate it up. Since then, I've been making pilaf once every couple of months.
You're an interesting man. Come on, don't let the broth boil over! Good luck!
